collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'In this paper, we first establish the productivity equation of radial multi-branch horizontal (RMBH) well in unconventional natural gas reservoirs, considering the dynamic change of permeability during the production process. Then, the productivity equation of radial horizontal well with 2 branches is compared with fractured vertical well and conventional horizontal well productivity equations proposed by former researchers. Finally, main factors influencing the productivity of unconventional natural gas RMBH well are analyzed, including well structure parameters, gas formation properties and production stage.'
